These API's fetch or manipulate information maintained for a patron by PATRON like loyalty balance, stop codes, tax information, comments, PATRON promos etc.</p></span><span style=\"color: #000000;font-family: verdana;font-size:12px;font-weight:bold\">API Authentication and Authorization:</span><br/><span style=\"color: #000000;font-family: verdana;font-size:12px\">Authentication and scope authorization for all the below listed Loyalty Profile Search APIs are managed using OAuth2 tokens</span><br/><span style=\"color: #000000;font-family: verdana;font-size:14px;font-weight:bold\">Player Profile search flows:</span><span style=\"color: #000000;font-family: verdana;font-size:12px; color: blue\"><p>From all e-commerce channel&rsquo;s (Web, mobile etc.) perspective, Loyalty Profile service should be viewed as a cache for customer profiles. Loyalty Profile system is constantly working to keep the cached profiles bi-directionally in sync with profiles managed by back-end systems such as PATRON, OPERA, ARCHTICS, SEVENROOMS and OPENTABLE.&nbsp; Loyalty Profile system considers PATRON to be the system of record for Mlife customers and OPERA, OPENTABLE, SEVENROOMS and ARCHTICS to be the system of record for transient customers. Most e-commerce APIs require the Loyalty Profile id as input. For example, functions such as Create Customer Itinerary or Make Room Reservation require a customer id with whom the itinerary and reservation being created are to be associated. Therefore, while executing a business flow all API clients usually have to identify the customer associated with that flow at the beginning of the flow and use the id of the profile through the flow.</p><p>If the customer profile is already identified by the means of Mlife number or Loyalty Profile System customerID then the detail profile can be pulled from Loyalty Profile System&rsquo;s Core set of APIs. Below set of APIs are for supporting workflows where the profile is not yet identified and has to be searched by non-unique parameters like first name, email, city etc. Player profile search is supported in three different ways as below.</p></span><span style=\"font-family: verdana;font-size:12px;\"><p><ol style=\"font-family: verdana;font-size:12px; list-style-type: upper-roman;\"><li><em>Only UCP cache search by free text: Profiles can be searched by passing only one searchable parameters like - first name, last name, email, phone number etc.</em></li><li><em>Only UCP cache search by filter: Profiles can be searched by passing a set of filter criteria like - first name, last name, email, phone, date of birth, Street address, city, state, country and postal code.<p></em></li><li><em>Source system and UCP cache search by filter: Profiles can be searched by passing a set of filter criteria like - first name, last name, email, phone, date of birth, Street address, city, state, country and postal code and clients will have control to search individual    source systems by passing flags for Opera, Patron etc.Management of customer information stored in PATRON.</em></li></ol><span style=\"color: #000000;font-family: verdana;font-size:12px\"><p>Below APIs are for retrieving manipulating information maintained for a patron by PATRON, like loyalty balance, stop codes, tax information, comments, PATRON promos etc. This information is retrieved on demand from PATRON by passing Patron loyalty number (Mlife number).</p></span>"
